# The Healthcare System: A Comparative Analysis #
## DH140 Final Project ##


**Description**

This project is based on the Hospital Dataset from the [The Collection of Really Great, Interesting, Situated Datasets (CORGIS)](https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/hospitals/). 

In order to better understand the varying experiences with healthcare across the Unites States, it compares the quality and cost of medical procedures of hospitals in California and Wyoming, the most populous and least populous states, respectively.

**Context and Motivation**

Access to healthcare in the United States is not a new issue, but it has been recently stressed by the COVID-19 pandemic. As asserted by the [National Library of Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3540621/), there are significant disparities in access to healthcare based on race and ethnicity. Drawing on the CORGIS dataset, this project seeks to discover if other barriers to heathcare exist such as price and quality of medical attention. 

I do not have prior experience working with healthcare data, nor am I particularly interested in the world of medicine. That said, the past few years of living through the COVID-19 pandemic have sparked my interest in uncovering the disparities felt within the healthcare system.

**Preliminary Research Questions**
1. Is there a correlation between medical costs and the quality of treatment?


2. Does the type of hospital (government, private, or proprietary) impact medical costs and the quality of treatment?
