# DH140 Final Project Brainstorm

**Data and Visualizations of Interest**

[Computational Perspectives in the History of Science](https://doi.org/10.1086/669891)

This article describes the potential uses of data science to better understand the history of science. Drawing on millennia of writings and material sources, the history of science is diverse and dense. The article is written in a positive tone that emphasizes all that could be achieved if researchers can rely on computer technology to help them organize and better understand their data. Most interestingly, the article notes that the use of data science will allow for new questions to be asked, effectively expanding the historical discipline.

I would love to learn how to make a network visualization. The visualization above comes from Stanford's "Mapping the Republic of Letters" project. It is really neat but also insightful to be able to see the connections between various figures of the period.

**Ideas for data to Investigate**

Potential Topics To Investigate:
* history
* literature
* religion


Potential Datasets To Investigate:
1. [National Heritage List for England](https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/)
2. [MoMA Collection](https://zenodo.org/record/164027#.Y8Li--zMKb8)
3. [National Archives Catalog](https://www.archives.gov/developer/national-archives-catalog-dataset)
4. [Religion and Literature's Unfinished Story](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25676899)
5. [Network Analysis 101](https://cphss.wustl.edu/methodsandstrategies/social-network-analysis/network-analysis-101/)
6. [Network Analysis](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs102/lectureslides/NetworksSlides.pdf)
7. [What is Text Analysis?](https://www.ceu.edu/tanad/what)
8. [What is text mining? IBM](https://www.ibm.com/topics/text-mining)
9. [British Architects on the Grand Tour in Eighteenth-Century Italy: Travels, People, Places](https://purl.stanford.edu/ct765rs0222)

In order to make the most of analyzing these datasets, I am most interested in the topics of weeks 6 and 8: text analysis and network analysis. One's diction and relationship network can reveal a lot about one's attitude and thoughts on certain topics and how they may have come to hold these opinions.

**Ideas from Curated Datasets and Project Lists**
|Dataset Name      | Description   | Link   |
|------------------|:-------------:|-------:|
|Survey of Scottish Witchcraft Database| This database was created by the School of History and Classics at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland and includes 4000 records of witchcraft beliefs and accusations. It also includes a glossary that defines unfamiliar words. It may be interesting to create a map and investigate if the documents are concentrated in specific areas of Scotland and the potential reasons for this.| [Link](http://witches.shca.ed.ac.uk/) |
|The Letters of Charles Darwin | This database includes the various letters send to and from Englishman and evolutionary biologist, Charles Darwin. It would be neat to create a network visualization in order to identify who he was in contact with and the frequency of their correspondence. Textual analysis could illuminate the important topics of discussion.  |[Link](https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letters/darwins-letters-timeline)   |
|Deaths in U.S. Jails      | This is a series of datasets releasing the previously undisclosed number of deaths in U.S. jails. It is broken down by state and could be an interesting comparative study of deaths by state. Looking at secondary material about differences in jail policies by states could illuminate potential reasons for the number of deaths. | [Link](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-jails-graphic/)   |
